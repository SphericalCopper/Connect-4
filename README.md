# Connect-4
Connect 4 Group Project

Fully functional version of the game Connect-4, with a couple of twists:
- Players are able to customize their board size, as well as the amount of discs that need to be connected to win.
- There is a "pop-out" option. Instead of dropping in a piece, players may remove one of their own pieces currently on the bottom row of the game board, thus moving all the pieces above it down a level. 
- Choose to play against a friend, or against the computer!

## How to play

Simply run the code on Python 3! The game will be playable in the console.
